I noticed you've uploaded a Jupyter notebook file for a K-Means clustering project. I'll help you draft a README file for your GitHub repository based on this project. Here's a general structure for the README:

# K-Means Clustering Project

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of K-Means clustering for unsupervised machine learning. K-Means clustering is a popular algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct groups based on feature similarity.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to a dataset in order to group similar data points into clusters. Clustering helps in understanding the underlying structure of the data and can be useful in a variety of domains such as market segmentation, pattern recognition, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes multiple features that are analyzed to form clusters. (You may want to provide more details here, such as where the dataset comes from or its key features.)

## Project Structure

The project includes the following file:
- **K_Means_Clustering.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook that contains the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- The following Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/K-Means-Clustering.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd K-Means-Clustering
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook K_Means_Clustering.ipynb
```

## Usage

The notebook can be used to:
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
2. Apply the K-Means algorithm to cluster the data.
3. Visualize the resulting clusters using various plots.
4. Experiment with different values of `k` (number of clusters) to observe how it affects the results.

## Results

- After running the notebook, you will see visualizations of the clusters formed by the K-Means algorithm.
- Elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
